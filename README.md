<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Superpy is a CLI application for supermarkets.

With Superpy you can do the following:
* Keep track of products bought
* Keep track of products sold

* Show profit and revenue in a graph

This way you have full control of your stock without having to rely on pen and paper.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Python and Pip

To use Superpy you need to have Python and Pip installed. Usually Pip is installed with python.
Here's how to check if you have python and pip installed:

Type in your terminal:

* Python

  ```sh
  python --version
  ```

* Pip

  ```sh
  pip --version
  ```

  If you get a version back for both, you are good to go! :smile:
  If not see below for help:

    [https://pypi.org/project/pip/](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

### Requirements

When you have python and pip installed there are some more requirements you need to use Superpy.
You can easily install these requirements with the [https://github.com/Chrisztiaan/Superpy/blob/main/requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file

Just use the below command in your terminal:
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
